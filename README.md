# Guess The Number Game

Welcome to the Guess The Number Game! This project offers an enjoyable and interactive guessing game where players attempt to guess a randomly selected number between 1 and 20. The game keeps track of your score, allowing you a maximum of 20 tries to guess the correct number. It also maintains a record of your highest score, challenging you to improve your guessing skills.

**Project Highlights:**
- **Game Mechanics:** Test your intuition and number-crunching abilities as you work your way through this guessing game, trying to uncover the hidden number within a limited number of attempts.
- **High Score Challenge:** Aim to beat your personal best and achieve the highest score possible. Be cautious, as going to zero means the game is lost!
- **Learning Experience:** This project was a valuable learning journey for me, especially in the realm of JavaScript fundamentals. It served as one of my initial experiences in working with the JavaScript language.

Below is a link to the demo of the game. Have fun, and may your guessing prowess lead you to victory!
